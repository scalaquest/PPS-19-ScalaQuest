# What is ScalaQuest?

ScalaQuest is an exam project for PPS and LSS courses in UNIBO, made by [Riccardo Maldini](https://www.riccardomaldini.it), [Filippo Nardini](https://github.com/lippo97), [Jacopo Corina](https://github.com/corinz97), [Francesco Gorini](https://github.com/francescogorini), [Thomas Angelini](https://github.com/ThomasAngeliniUnibo).

The basic idea is to create a framework for the implementation of games of the [Interactive Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) genre, in which the player can use text commands to influence the environment and continue in the game (e.g. [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)).

# Official documentation

The official documentation of the project consists in:
- the official Scaladoc of the [Core](./scaladoc/core/index.html) and [CLI](./scaladoc/core/index.html) modules;
- the official coverage reports for the [Core](./coverage/core/index.html) and [CLI](./coverage/core/index.html) modules;
- One report per course, and some additional appendix documents, that can be found in the project [reports repository](https://github.com/scalaquest/reports).
