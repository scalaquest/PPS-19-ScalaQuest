ScalaQuest is an exam project for PPS and LSS courses in UNIBO, made by
[Riccardo Maldini](https://www.riccardomaldini.it),
[Filippo Nardini](https://github.com/lippo97),
[Jacopo Corina](https://github.com/corinz97),
[Francesco Gorini](https://github.com/francescogorini),
[Thomas Angelini](https://github.com/ThomasAngeliniUnibo).

The basic idea is to create a framework for the implementation of games of the
[Interactive Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) genre,
in which the player can use text commands to influence the environment and
continue in the game (e.g. [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)).
