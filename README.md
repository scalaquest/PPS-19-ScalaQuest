## The idea behind the project

The basic idea is to create a framework for the implementation of games of the
[Interactive Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) genre,
in which the player can use text commands to influence the environment and
continue in the game (e.g. [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)).

## Official documentation

The official documentation of the project consists in:
- [PPS Report](https://scalaquest.github.io/reports/reports/pps.html) and [LSS Report](https://scalaquest.github.io/reports/reports/lss.html). The previous links shows a web version of reports, auto-generated from the [report sources](https://github.com/scalaquest/reports). You can also consult them in a [PDF LaTeX](https://github.com/scalaquest/reports/releases/latest) format.
- the official Scaladoc of the [Core](./scaladoc/core/index.html) and [CLI](./scaladoc/cli/index.html) modules;
- the official Coverage reports for the [Core](./coverage/core/index.html) and [CLI](./coverage/cli/index.html) modules.
