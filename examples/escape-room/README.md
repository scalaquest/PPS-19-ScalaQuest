# The Escape Room example

EscapeRoom is the first example created for ScalaQuest. The example is created
using mainly configuring builders and `Item`s given by the library.

You can find more details about the example, and a set of instructions to complete
the story in this [appendix file](https://scalaquest.github.io/Reports/appendix/appendix.html).
